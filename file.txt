i will never forget
the night i saw my father cry´
i was frightened and alone
and his tears were burning in my eyes
deep in my soul´
i held him ight
and ried to ease the pain.

faher in heaven
it`s no secre at all
when you think of your children
How hard it is for them
two tender tears fall from your eyes
and Your cries
shake the world
i cannot bear to see You this way.




i know it´s tears of love
but still it hurts me just the same,
You have always held my hand
now i want to hold Yours too
and be there for You,
don´t You agre´,
it´s time to send the tears away
