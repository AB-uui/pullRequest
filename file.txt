faher in heaven
it`s no secre at all
when you think of your children
how far they are from home
two tender tears fall from your eyes
and Your cries
shake the world
i cannot bear to see You this way.




i know it´s tears of love
but still it hurts me just the same,
You have always held my hand
now i want to hold Yours too
and be there for You,
don´t You agre´,
it´s time to send the tears away
