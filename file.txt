faher in heaven
it`s no secre at all
when you think of your children
how far they are from home
two tender tears fall from your eyes
and Your cries
shake the world
i cannot bear to see You this way.


father don´t cry
i love you oo much to see you in pain
only You´who created tears
can wipe them away forever.
so bring on the day
when tere´ll be only joy
You and i will smile,
bring on teh day
when tere´ll be no more tears
we´ll never cry again.
